                Born at around the first week of November 2020, Salem was seemingly abandoned by his biological cat mother at just around <span style="font-weight: bold">4 weeks old</span>. He was found alone in front of the Cruz residence shivering from the cold, yet meowing as loud as he could for help. He was finally picked up by Erika's dad in the morning of December 17, 2020   as they were getting ready to leave for work, leaving Erika alone with a new kitten that day. 
            
                <br><br>Despite having a rough kittenhood - pot-bellied, dirty, and malnourished - Salem grew up to be a healthy boy with an attitude   similar to his namesake and a coat as <span style="font-weight: bolder;">soft as velvet</span>.
